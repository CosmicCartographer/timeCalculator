# Time Calculator

Here is a simple project that is good for beginner web developers to add to and test out. It is simply a calculator that you plug in the beginning and end time and then see the difference!

Stay tuned for more updates to follow, or feel free to add your own suggestions to make the program better.

Cheers!
